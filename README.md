# phase-type-ageing-model
The likelihood calculation and MLE for the phase-type ageing model  (PTAM)

estimatefun_fix.m is for the MLE for the PTAM

PTAM.m calculates the likelihood/probability density function for the PTAM

PTAM_survival.m calculates the survival function for the PTAM

PTAM_ht.m calculates the hazard function for the PTAM

yashin.m simulates lifetime observation from the Le Bras model and obtains the MLE for the PTAM

special.m is used for the simulation in yashin.m

accuracy_comparision.m compares the accuracy of our method and the traditional method for the likelihood evalution for the PTAM

efficency_comparison.m compares the speed of our method and the traditional method for the likelihood evalution for the PTAM
